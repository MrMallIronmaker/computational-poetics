Zach Emig has arrived so early to pick up his children at
their Brooklyn elementary school that he has turned the cafeteria
into his ad hoc congressional campaign office, working on speeches
until school lets out.

Christina Hart spent so many bitter mornings waiting in the cold for
the bakery in Manhattan where she works to open that the entire crew 
now gets there early, a solution the owner cooked up so she wouldn't
quit.

And Matt Apter, a tour guide, has had to find refuge from inclement
weather in churches around Times Square because he arrives well before
his customers.

All three have this in common: They all use the New York City subway
to get where they need to be. Yes, the same subway that has become
the target of expletive-filled social media rants for its dependably
woeful performance. The same subway with an on-time rate that has
plunged to levels never before seen.

But the system's descent into chronic unreliability has become so
embedded in the psyches of riders that many are overcompensating,
adding extra time to their trips. In one of the more counterintuitive
conundrums to emerge from this confounding city, the subway has been
making people early.
