The best package I've seen for this is Gensim,
found at the Gensim Homepage. I've used it many times, and 
overall been very happy with it's ease of use; it is written
in Python, and has an easy to follow tutorial to get you 
started, which compares 9 strings. It can be installed via 
pip, so you won't have a lot of hassle getting it installed
I hope.

Which scoring algorithm you use depends heavily on the context 
of your problem, but I'd suggest starting of with the LSI 
functionality if you want something basic. (That's what the tutorial
walks you through.)

If you go through the tutorial for gensim, it will walk you through
comparing two strings, using the Similarities function. This will
allow you to see how your stings compare to each other, or to some
other sting, on the basis of the text they contain.
